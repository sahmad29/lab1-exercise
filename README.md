# What I hope to learn in INFO201 

The one skill I hope learn from this class is the ability
to understand and *use R*. 

I can tell I have **very** qualified teachers and TAs who are
dedicated to teaching their students so I am *excited*!

Other skills I have already learned that I didn't expect to are:
- How to use GitBash and command line
- How to use GitHub 

I can't wait for the rest of the quarter!
